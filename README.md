OOP Machine Learning Project

-- Insurance Predictor --

This project is a machine learning model which reads information in from a dataset.
It creates a hashmap to determine how many of each attribute combination is present, with both its yes and no count. 
It then allows the user to select one of each of the four attributes in the GUI panel, and returns both the prediction of insurance and probability in a percentage.
